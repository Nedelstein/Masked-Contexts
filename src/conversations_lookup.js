      "Hi Noah, \n\nYour mail has me deeply concerned as the purpose of use appears to be suspect. If detection of objects etc. is some kind of a game or quiz, then so be it, but if it has any sinister concerns like security, spying etc., then I think I'd better re-consider the licensing of the picture. \n\nTo address your last question first, I generally do not have any problem with people using my photos as they are all under Flickr Creative Commons licensing, so one is free to download and use the pictures as long as they credit the photographer/ owner of the photo. I get scores of people asking me for permission to use my pictures and I generally never refuse, except once where someone asked if he could use many of my pictures and mention that he took them. Almost all cases have been genuine, and many even give a link to where they have used my picture, so as long as it seems legitimate and legal, it's ok. Of course I do not maintain a database of who asked for which picture for use so whenever I see any of my pictures used somewhere, with acknowledgement or mentioning me as the owner, I generally do not object. And it's all on Creative Commons anyway. \n\nNow as for the context of the picture. The original file is here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/shankaronline/9361758867 \n\nAnd this is part of a photo album: https://www.flickr.com/photos/shankaronline/albums/72157634790268784 \n\nI was on holiday in the Philippines, back in 2013 and had a local kid with me- a girl- who's education I was sponsoring for a couple of years. (she turned out to be a real gold digger and was getting greedy due to which I had to cut her off, but that's another story). We were on our way to see the Taal volcano (which erupted recently- thank goodness I had visited it in 2013!). \n\nThe general practice is to take a boat from the shore to the crater, and then either walk up the mountain or take a horse. I was very confident of myself and my physical endurance (despite my being 53 at the time a diabetic) and assured the girl that I will make it all the way up on foot. I was in fact sneering at those who were coming down riding the horse. (hence the 'scoffing' remark). \n\nI had read that the charges for the horse would go down as you move away from the horse rank. Indeed, it was bloody hot that day, the overal heat from the active volcano was making my feet burn and I was getting spooked by steam coming out of vents on the ground. So in the end, I had to bite the bullet and take on the next horse which approached me, incidentally at a much lower price that what was initially quoted at the foot of the mountain. \n\nSo that's it really- it's a holiday snapshot. \n\nI really hope the Coco thing is only a game or quiz or something to help people identify objects, but if there are any security or infringement upon peoples' privacy or spying issues, I'd better change the licensing for all my photos. \n\nAnd finally, from the tone of your message (I mean the content), I hope you are from Flickr administration or someone in authority, as I have given a lot of information here! \n\nDo let me know of any security concerns. \n\nThanks and regards. \nShankar",
