      "Hi Noah, \n\nYour mail has me deeply concerned as the purpose of use appears to be suspect. If detection of objects etc. is some kind of a game or quiz, then so be it, but if it has any sinister concerns like security, spying etc., then I think I'd better re-consider the licensing of the picture. \n\nTo address your last question first, I generally do not have any problem with people using my photos as they are all under Flickr Creative Commons licensing, so one is free to download and use the pictures as long as they credit the photographer/ owner of the photo. I get scores of people asking me for permission to use my pictures and I generally never refuse, except once where someone asked if he could use many of my pictures and mention that he took them. Almost all cases have been genuine, and many even give a link to where they have used my picture, so as long as it seems legitimate and legal, it's ok. Of course I do not maintain a database of who asked for which picture for use so whenever I see any of my pictures used somewhere, with acknowledgement or mentioning me as the owner, I generally do not object. And it's all on Creative Commons anyway. \n\nNow as for the context of the picture. The original file is here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/shankaronline/9361758867 \n\nAnd this is part of a photo album: https://www.flickr.com/photos/shankaronline/albums/72157634790268784 \n\nI was on holiday in the Philippines, back in 2013 and had a local kid with me- a girl- who's education I was sponsoring for a couple of years. (she turned out to be a real gold digger and was getting greedy due to which I had to cut her off, but that's another story). We were on our way to see the Taal volcano (which erupted recently- thank goodness I had visited it in 2013!). \n\nThe general practice is to take a boat from the shore to the crater, and then either walk up the mountain or take a horse. I was very confident of myself and my physical endurance (despite my being 53 at the time a diabetic) and assured the girl that I will make it all the way up on foot. I was in fact sneering at those who were coming down riding the horse. (hence the 'scoffing' remark). \n\nI had read that the charges for the horse would go down as you move away from the horse rank. Indeed, it was bloody hot that day, the overal heat from the active volcano was making my feet burn and I was getting spooked by steam coming out of vents on the ground. So in the end, I had to bite the bullet and take on the next horse which approached me, incidentally at a much lower price that what was initially quoted at the foot of the mountain. \n\nSo that's it really- it's a holiday snapshot. \n\nI really hope the Coco thing is only a game or quiz or something to help people identify objects, but if there are any security or infringement upon peoples' privacy or spying issues, I'd better change the licensing for all my photos. \n\nAnd finally, from the tone of your message (I mean the content), I hope you are from Flickr administration or someone in authority, as I have given a lot of information here! \n\nDo let me know of any security concerns. \n\nThanks and regards. \nShankar",

The photo was published under a Creative Commons Attribution licence, so they ought to acknowledge me as the author of the work if they had intended to republish it.

I'm always on the lookout for any scene that allows me to take a photo to donate to the Creative Commons. Since this one featured two identical umbrellas, which is a scene you don't normally see unless it's two black ones (and there are also two black ones to reinforce this impression) it seemed like an ideal image to share. That's all there is to it.\n\nAs for the image being scraped from Flickr, I'm against the idea in principle as they could very well have scraped some copyrighted images along with it. Also, no attribution can be given in these circumstances. And attribution tells people where they can come to find more CC photos.",

      "This photo was taken at dusk on my local beach in Adelaide, South Australia. It’s in April so getting cooler in the southern hemisphere. One of the two fishermen is completely covered, but it can’t be too cold because the other is wearing shorts. \n\nAdelaide faces west so we routinely get magnificent sunsets. This photo is taken on an evening with pastel skies – an extra treat when atmospheric conditions are just right. \n\nI walk along this stretch of beach several times a month, always with camera in hand. I don’t know how fruitful it is to do this kind of shore fishing – most people locally choose to fish from the nearby jetty - but in non-swimming seasons it is not an uncommon sight to see people fishing from the shore. \n\nI often take photographs of shore fishermen at this time of the day because they and their rods and lines often present intriguing silhouettes in the fading light. \n\nThe dog is a bonus here. As it says in the comments beneath the photo: \n\n'What was funny when I took this photo was the fact that this dog decided to stop and look like he was with 2 guys fishing. He actually belonged to someone else and wandered off to them after I took the pic!\n\nThe sea, as is often the case here In Adelaide, is dead calm. Adelaide is on a gulf so does not face open ocean and never gets what you’d call ‘surf’.\n\nAs all my photos have the least restrictive Creative Commons license I accept that they can end up almost anywhere. Really the only condition is that however and wherever my photos are used there should be some visible attribution/acknowledgement of me as the creator of the image somewhere. There is no obligation on the part of the end user to notify the owner of the image, nor ask for permission to use it, though many people do so out of courtesy – something I always appreciate. I would receive at least one email per fortnight asking permission to use a photo of mine in a book, website, newsletter, et \n\nI guess it would be nice if the people behind the dataset at cocodataset.org/#explore?id=504697 did notify Flickr users that their photos were being used in this way, but ultimately I’m more intrigued than annoyed that one of my images has turned up on this site.",

      "Sera Noah,\n\nThank you for your email. I apologize for the slow response. My father died 3 weeks ago and I have been tied up with his estate.\n\nThe photo was taken at the intersection of lighthouse road and Zion Church road in eastern Sussex county, Delaware. I grew up a few miles east of this intersection. The reasons I took the photos are several. I have always enjoyed old photos and see how things have changed or when they changed. When I was young the intersection had no traffic lights, just a stop sign. Plus a lot of farm land. Lighthouse road was only a two lane road. The area has seen a lot of growth in the last 20 years due to the beaches and ocean. Due to traffic they had to add a center lane on lighthouse road and make other improvements. I like to document things so I took a whole series of photos during the improvements.\n\nI’m ok with the use of the photo I just like to be notified when it was used and for what so I can keep track of my photos that have been used. I’ve sold some photos in the past to many different companies and had many others used for free. I just liked to know.\n\nRegard,\nLee Canno",

      "Hi Noah\n\nThis is a tricky one. The origin is under copyright so permission should have been sought. At first, I thought it was only an outline of an undetectable photo but looking at how it works, the URL square gives a link to share and the last square hides segmentations, so the original is seen. Surely this is not allowed under Flickr licences? How do other photographers feel about this?\n\nBut, in hindsight, I did go to the link, copied and pasted (into Corel Paintshop Pro). It saves as 193.8k max - hardly worth bothering about.\n\nBackground: The photo was of a (late) friend of mine, Chris. A friend made a birthday cake for him and the decorations on top were modelled on the flowers in the vase. The flowers were from his garden.\n\nThank you for your vigilance, Noah, if you need more of my support, please let me know.\n\nThanks\nCheer\nSandy",

While I'm guessing it doesn't technically violate the non-commercial use term of the license, it isn't quite the usage I had in mind.\n\nAs a software developer myself, I am very concerned with facial recognition and other surveillance technologies being misused, both by law enforcement and private companies/individuals. It's often difficult to separate 'good' use from 'bad' use, and in this case it's probably some of each.\n\nI believe we're in a world where these technologies are unavoidable and ubiquitous, and I don't see that changing. However, my hope is that we will move toward cultural and legal prohibitions against misuse of these tools, with severe penalties for violators. For example, restricting what types of warrant-less surveillance data is admissible in court or usable in commercial products.\n\nThanks again for letting me know about this.

I’ve posted my images in Flickr under a “creative commons” license which allows the images to be used by others with the only requirement being that I request attribution - e.g. “image by Chas Redmond,”  or similar.\n\nSo, in the highest level of application, the photo was used within prescribed constraints. I used to work for NASA for 32 years during which time surveillance technologies advanced considerably, as did the recognition software. This current use of the photo does not surprise, nor alarm me, almost like fire is inevitable in any forest.\n\nThe image is one of the many booths at the West Seattle (neighborhood in Seattle, WA) Farmers Market, which, when this photo was taken, used to be in a parking lot immediately adjacent to the center of the neighborhood business district.  I also photographed other vendors, mostly for the purpose of showing off a local farmers market and the variety of vendor and fresh or prepared items available.  Since this photo was taken, the West Seattle Farmers Market has moved onto the main neighborhood business street (California Ave, SW) which is closed for 6 hours on Sundays for a 1-block area.\n\nIf this photo was part of an AI image learning exercise, I could see the marked areas being ID’d as - person, sign, food, other item, so in the sense of why this photo, it seems to be a good example of differentiating humans from a complex scene with multiple multicolored items containing some similar geometry and sizing.",

      "Noah,\n\nAlways interested in discussing things AI and surveillance.  A little more backstory about me: I’m a fairly even-keeled person and observing opposing or differing opinions on a subject as touchy and personal as surveillance feeds my anthropology muse. Yes, working at NASA exposed me to an incredible array of ways to “observe” something or someone. Also, though, my position carried some weight with the responsibilities, meaning I was often undergoing yet another background check or verification of my honesty and truthfulness. Having a secret clearance or any special access usually means that the person who has this access, him/herself is observed and known. This is why Edward Snowden’s disclosures were so profound - he was believed to be incapable of either seeing what was going on or not having the wherewithall to disclose it - “no one would believe him.\n\nSo, yes, it does impact me as I take a huge number of photographs in what might be reasonably considered “public” places where one should not have an expectation of privacy and I then post them to a publically available space.  Meaning I’m advertantly or inadvertantly putting someone’s picture on the net and I may not even know the person. In addition to knowing a great deal about me, my past, present, and any indiscretions, as a government employee my salary, number of members of my immediate family and their names, sex and ages, my address and whether or not I owned any other assets, were all known not just to the government but to anyone interested in what a Government employee does and how he/she is compensated. That made my lffe a bit easier in some ways - there was nothing anyone could really surprise me with and everyone knew how poor/not poor I and my family were. Not everyone has the same requirement of transparency hoisted upon them - but I also swore an allegiance to defend and protect the Constitution - every Fed does, so I accepted being surveilled and questioned as a necessary element of my job.\n\nFor a long time now I’ve been somewhat interested in how the United Kingdom treats their citizens and privacy.  In many ways they are even more severe than the United States with respect to spying on its own citizens - and although the US can eliminate folks in any number of ways, the US does not - unlike the United Kingdom - have an Official Secrets Act (though J. Edgar Hoover did some nafarious things, for sure).\n\nAnd, I’ve been an early adopter of “public access” software - was a blogger in the ‘90s, have LinkedIn, Flickr accounts which are very old. Have Facebook and Twitter accounts which are also about a decade old - so I’ve been unconcerned about “my” privacy but am very concerned about how governments treat privacy. I’m not unaware that some actions I have taken or might be taking can or might cause harm to others through some mechanism I don’t control. That has and continues to stiffle me - privacy we might want but we might not be aware of how we inadvertantly expose someone else’s privacy. A good example of this is my son and daughter-in-law have requested that only they post photographs of their children (my grandchildren). This I agree with and can abide - the kids, now 8 and 10, are savvy but not so savvy they would be cautious about their privacy, so I accept their parents’ request and keep their images out of my social media stream.\n\nIf I said I was a Black Mirror fan would that allow the comparisons with the US and the UK make a bit more sense?\n\nThanks for the conversation - ready for more if warranted or you want.\n\nchas",

It's an elementary manner, isn't it?\n\nWell, that's my opinion about the use of my photos.\n\nThanks again for your kind notice this time. I appreciate it very much.  It's good to know there are many people who have open minds and good will.\n\nI hope you are having a good time in spite of the outrage of a new disease (Japan is now being frenzied by covid-19__, you know)..\n\nWith best wishes.",

      "I have two photos of 143 620 on Flikr, one at Bristol Temple Meads and one at Stapleton Road. There is no backstory involved; I am a railway enthusiast and have taken many thousands of railway photos all over the world since 1962. I have had 5 railway photography books published by Amberley Publishing. My photos all have a Creative Commons copyright so anyone can use them. Many of my photos appear on Wikipedia and Wikimedia whilst several authors have used my photos in their books/magazine articles - though they have asked my permission first (even though technically they needn't have but did so out of courtesy). So there is little I can do to object to Microsoft using my photos. However, I do find it odd that my photos have been used to build a data set for surveillance as I can can't really see how those of 143 620 could help in that. Whilst I can appreciate why the government need to have a reasonable surveillance/detection system, why does Microsoft need such a system? It seems somewhat sinister. What is your interest in all this?",

      "That's rather interesting, John. Most of my flickr photos are licensed CC0 so I don't expect notifications; this was one of many that flickr's process for changing licenses failed so it's in it's original CC-BY. The link you sent has a meager attribution, so I have nothing to really complain about, although the use of imagery for surveillance is something I feel less than comfortable with. The balance is, when images are shared, sometimes you accept they are used in ways you do not prefer (my own photos of myself are often used to create fake profiles of scammers).\n\nThat was a photo showing off a camera strap cover a friend had sewn for me, in th mirror it looked a bit like a tie, the irony being I own maybe one tie. It was photographed in my previous home in Strawberry, Arizona.\n\nThanks for letting me know about this.\n\nAlan",

      "It took me a while to place the year. It was 2011 at the fashion show at Gearcon in Portland, Oregon. It was posted on Flickr with 'Some right reserved.' At some point since then I reserve all rights.\n\nI have a friend who is a magician who probably made the connection for me, but I don't recall how he was associated with it. Over the intervening years I took photos at Gearcon on many occasions.\n\nI am not happy that my photo is being used to train recognition software, although there is nothing that can be done now about it. It's a slippery slope we find ourselves on trading security for lack of privacy.\n\nYou must have more than a passing interest to track an obscure photo down to me.

      "Weird. I had no idea about this until I saw your email.\n\nI took this photo in Moosonee, Ontario, back in 2012. I was with a friend, riding the Polar Bear Express train, which runs between Cochrane Ontario and Moosonee, which has no regular road access to the rest of North America, but has the Ontario Northland Railway, an airport, and winter ice road connections.\n\nThough the Polar Bear Express is a passenger train, it carries express freight and flatbed cars for transporting vehicles. I was fascinated by it.\n\nI am annoyed, now that I know, because my photos are for my own use, along with friends, though I have responded to requests from time to time.\n\nThanks,\nSean",

But I do know the vast majority of my photos are set to a Creative Commons license, so there’s likely no foul for it being used as long as it’s credited.\n\nDon’t mind sharing a little context. Just a simple shot of my father, cousin’s husband, and cousin’s kids playing MK Wii.\n\nJust for curiosity sake may I ask your involvement with the project and/or my photo?",

Clearly the generic caption wouldn't really have had any way to know the family unit in the photo, but other than the fact I think I said (or at least should have) cousin's kids (plural), that description would match the generic description for the four people. My more specific description was probably more for your interest than of any use for AI purposes.\n\nThanks for the update. Cheers!",

      "Hello Noah,\n\nThanks for the note, it is much appreciated. The photo was taken from my album titled 'Are we there yet? Road Trip '08' I took the picture at an amateur rodeo at  Bryce Canyon Country Rodeo, Utah hosted by Ruby Inn. Here is a link to my photo and the album and it shows the camera I used and all the EXIF data.\n\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/atomichotlinks/2672069224/in/photostream\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/atomichotlinks/albums/72157606960109071\n\nIf Microsoft created the dataset was it them or another organization that used the Flickr community's photos?\n\nThe Creative Commons is pretty clear.\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/\n\nIf you look at my photo and the link you sent me of how my photo was used they cropped the heck out of the image, changed it to black & white as well as not give me any credit.\n\nIf they want to continue to use my photo I would like to get credit and give me what they  think is fair $$. It's not the most clear photo because it was a wann-be DSLR point & shoot camera. I am surprised it was even considered because it's a medium-resolution image.\n\nI'm not trying to be a 'Dick' about it. The internet is still the wild wild west in my opinion and photographers are never going to be able to put a complete stop to their photos being used without their permission.\n\nA Film company doing a documentary recently took care of me because a staff member of a museum gave them a photo of mine to use without my permission.\nThanks, Brian Crawford aka Atomic Hot Links\n\nIf you want to call me- (***)***-****",
